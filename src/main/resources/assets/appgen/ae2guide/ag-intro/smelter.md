# Smelter

<BlockImage id="appgen:smelter" scale="8" p:working="true"/>

The Smelter is a block that smelts items using AE instead of fuels.
The Smelter consumes 20 AE/t when smelting items.

## Settings

The Smelter can send the outputs to adjacent storage blocks.

## Upgrades

The Smelter supports the following [upgrades](ae2:items-blocks-machines/upgrade_cards.md):

-   <ItemLink id="ae2:speed_card" /> multiplies the processing speed of the Smelter by 2, for a max of 1600% of the base smelting speed.
    (The AE consumption per item does not change.)
